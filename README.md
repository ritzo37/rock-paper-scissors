# rock-paper-scissors

This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations curriculum . 

This project helped me to get a better understanding of JavaScript and mainly about the interaction of JS with the HTML which is achieved using DOM .

As I progressed in the project I got a clear understanding of working of querySelectors and most importantly adding event listeners to the elements that I select . Overall I got a quick overview on the working of JS along with HTML as a script language .
